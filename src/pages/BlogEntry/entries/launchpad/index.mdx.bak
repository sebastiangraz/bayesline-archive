# Untapped potential

In a constantly changing environment, companies must adapt to survive. The quest for growth, resilience, and a competitive edge demands continuous innovation and optimization in the face of emerging technologies, shifting markets, and intense competition.

This is an array `[1, 2, 3]{:js}` of numbers 1 through 3.
The name of the function is `getStringLength{:.entity.name.function}`.

# In a constantly changing environment, companies must adapt to survive.

```js
console.log(1);
```

```js showLineNumbers {1-2,5}
export function* FibonacciSequence() {
  let [a, b] = [0, 1];
  while (true) {
    yield a;
    [a, b] = [b, a + b];
  }
}
```

```css showLineNumbers /inline-block/ /Other/ /2rem/ /code[data-line-numbers-max-digits='3']/
code > [data-line]::before {
  counter-increment: line;
  content: counter(line); # [!code highlight]
  /* Other styling */
  display: inline-block;
}

code[data-line-numbers-max-digits='2'] > [data-line]::before { # [!code highlight]
  width: 2rem;
}

code[data-line-numbers-max-digits='3'] > [data-line]::before {
  width: 3rem;
}
```

```js
const fib = FibonacciSequence();
fib.next().value; // 0
fib.next().value; // 1
// 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34
