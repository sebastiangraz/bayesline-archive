It involves the use of mathematical models to assess and quantify the risks associated with various financial instruments, portfolios, and strategies. By using risk models, financial institutions can better understand the potential risks they face and make more informed decisions to manage and mitigate those risks.

Yet, a powerful source of untapped potential is often overlooked by companies: effective net working capital (NWC) management.
Our white paper embarks on a captivating investigative journey, delving into the world of NWC management. We do not just present theories or generic advice - we conduct a thorough investigation to uncover the often-hidden potential within this crucial cross-company discipline.
